abstract = {Two adjacent British Columbia, Canada, watersheds with similar topographical features were studied. Both the Black Mountain Irrigation District (BMID) and the Vernon Irrigation District (VID) serve rural agricultural communities which are active in cattle ranching. The present study was carried out in five phases, during which a total of 249 surface water samples were tested in the study watersheds. The aims of these phases were to determine levels of parasite contamination in raw water samples collected from the intakes as well as from other sites in each watershed and to investigate cattle in the watersheds as potential sources of parasite contamination of surface drinking water supplies. Giardia cysts were not detected in the raw water samples collected from lake sources at the headwaters of both watersheds but were found in 100\% (70 or 70) of water samples collected at the BMID intake and 97\% (68 of 70) of water samples collected at the VID intake. Significantly higher levels (P < 0.05) of Giardia cysts were found at the BMID intake (phase 1, 7 to 2,215 cysts per 100 liters; phase 3, 4.6 to 1,880 cysts per 100 liters) when compared with that of the VID intake (2 to 114 cysts per 100 liters). The BMID watershed has a more complex system of surface water sources than the VID watershed. Cattle have access to creeks in the BMID watershed, whereas access is restricted in the VID watershed. Collection of raw water samples from a creek upstream and downstream of a cattle ranch in the BMID watershed showed that the downstream location had significantly higher (P < 0.05) levels (0.6 to 42.9 cysts per 100 liters and 1.4 to 300.0 oocysts per 100 liters) of both Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts than those of the upstream location (0.5 to 34.4 cysts per 100 liters and 0.5 to 34.4 oocysts per 100 liters). Peak concentrations of both parasites coincided with calving activity. Fecal samples, collected from cattle in both watersheds, showed 10\% (3 of 30) in the BMID and 50\% (5 of 10) in the VID watersheds to be Giardia positive. No Cryptosporidium-positive fecal samples were found. Giardia cysts isolated from the BMID watershed were repeatedly infective to gerbils in contrast to those from the VID watershed. The 10 BMID drinking water Giardia isolates retrieved into culture and biotyped showed zymodeme and karyotype heterogeneity. The differences in patterns of parasite contamination and cattle management practices contribute to the unique watershed characteristics observed between two areas which are topographically similar and geographically adjacent.},

abstract = {The survival of various isolates of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts under a range of environmental pressures including freezing, desiccation, and water treatment processes and in physical environments commonly associated with oocysts such as feces and various water types was monitored. Oocyst viability was assessed by in vitro excystation and by a viability assay based on the exclusion or inclusion of two fluorogenic vital dyes. Although desiccation was found to be lethal, a small proportion of oocysts were able to withstand exposure to temperatures as low as -22 degrees C. The water treatment processes investigated did not affect the survival of oocysts when pH was corrected. However, contact with lime, ferric sulfate, or alum had a significant impact on oocyst survival if the pH was not corrected. Oocysts demonstrated longevity in all water types investigated, including seawater, and when in contact with feces were considered to develop an enhanced impermeability to small molecules which might increase the robustness of the oocysts when exposed to environmental pressures.},

@article{Hunter2005,
abstract = {The molecular characterisation of Giardia and Cryptosporidium has given rise to a more epidemiological meaningful and robust taxonomy. Importantly, molecular tools are now available for 'typing' isolates of the parasites directly from clinical and environmental samples. As a consequence, information on zoonotic potential has been obtained although the frequency of zoonotic transmission is still poorly understood. Analysis of outbreaks and case-control studies, especially when coupled with genotyping data, is slowly providing information on the public health significance of zoonotic transmission. Such studies support the hypothesis that Cryptosporidium hominis is spread only between humans but that the major reservoir for Cryptosporidium parvum is domestic livestock, predominantly cattle, and that direct contact with infected cattle is a major transmission pathway along with indirect transmission through drinking water. The situation is less clearcut for Giardia duodenalis but the evidence does not, in general, support zoonotic transmission as a major risk for human infections. However, for both parasites there is a need for molecular epidemiological studies to be undertaken in well-defined foci of transmission in order to fully determine the frequency and importance of zoonotic transmission.},
